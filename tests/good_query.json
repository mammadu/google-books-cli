                "description": "The inspiring, life-changing bestseller by the author of LEADERS EAT LAST and TOGETHER IS BETTER. In 2009, Simon Sinek started a movement to help people become more inspired at work, and in turn inspire their colleagues and customers. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, including more than 28 million who\u2019ve watched his TED Talk based on START WITH WHY -- the third most popular TED video of all time. Sinek starts with a fundamental question: Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world all think, act, and communicate the same way -- and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.",

                "description": "Wall Street Journal best-selling author Jon Acuff reveals the steps to getting unstuck and back onto the path of being awesome. Over the last 100 years, the road to success for most everyone has been divided into five stages that mirror the decades of working life: Your 20s are a period of Learning. This is the decade of trying a thousand things, exploring a multitude of interests, and discovering what really motivates you. Your 30s are a period of Editing. This is the decade of sorting out interests, where you discover what you really care about and who you really are. Your 40s are a period of Mastering. This is the decade of narrowing focus, honing skill sets, and becoming an expert in your field. Your 50s are a period of Harvesting. This is the decade of reaping the benefits of good decisions and enjoying the highest income-earning period in a career. Your 60s are a period of Guiding. This is the decade of mentoring, training, and encouraging others on their own road to success. Every successful person has followed these steps regardless of their occupation. But three things have changed the path to success and erased the decades associated with them: Finish lines are dead \u2013 Boomers are realizing that a lot of the things they were promised aren\u2019t going to materialize, and they have started second and third careers. Anyone can play \u2013 Technology has given access to an unprecedented number of people who are building online empires and changing their lives in ways that would have been impossible years ago. Hope is boss \u2013 The days of \u201csuccess first, significance later,\u201d have ended. A new generation doesn\u2019t want to change the world eventually; they want to change it now through the wells they kickstart in Africa and the TOMS they wear on their feet. The value system has been flipped upside down. The result is that you\u2019ve got an entire generation pushing down to start over, another generation pushing up to start for the first time, and in the middle of this collision, the tools to actually change the world. Experience years now trump chronological age. And while none of the five stages can be skipped, they can be shortened and accelerated. There are only two paths in life: average and awesome. The average path is easy because all you have to do is nothing. The awesome path is more challenging, because things like fear only bother you when you do work that matters. The good news is Start gives readers practical, honest, actionable insights to be more awesome, more often. It\u2019s time to punch fear in the face, escape average, and do work that matters. It\u2019s time to Start.",

With the savvy of foreign policy insiders, Senor and Singer examine the lessons of the country's adversity-driven culture, which flattens hierarchy and elevates informality-- all backed up by government policies focused on innovation. In a world where economies as diverse as Ireland, Singapore and Dubai have tried to re-create the \"Israel effect\", there are entrepreneurial lessons well worth noting. As America reboots its own economy and can-do spirit, there's never been a better time to look at this remarkable and resilient nation for some impressive, surprising clues.",

Dr. Laura Schlessinger agrees that there are things worth whining about. A certain amount of whining allows for venting of reasonable pain, disappointment, fear, frustration, or rage. However, staying stuck in whining mode can become a lifelong problem. This is where Dr. Laura steps in with Stop Whining, Start Living to help folks conquer the temptation to retreat from living life to the fullest. Illustrated by calls and letters from members of Dr. Laura's huge international audience, Stop Whining, Start Living features testimonials from real people facing real challenges. These folks have benefited enormously from Dr. Laura's powerful lessons. Stop Whining, Start Living gives readers the jump start they need to break out of reactive mode and get proactive, moving in the direction of a joyful, meaningful, fulfilling, and purposeful future. Everyone can use a kick in the pants sometimes, and Dr. Laura, who \"preaches, teaches, and nags\" to millions every day on her radio program, is here to deliver it!",

An incubator, accelerator or science park all have this goal but provide a variety of foci and support. At a minimum, it\u2019s important to not only attract entrepreneurs but to have support services that can include mentoring, financial support and other services that make the incubator really filled with energy and potential. It\u2019s becoming insufficient to just have office space and WiFi. It is also important to develop good interactions between directors, the start-up community and residents. Managing the community to help residents to launch successfully is the main goal of the director. It\u2019s also important to stay abreast of the innovations happening in start-up support. Today there are many ways to incubate from bare bones office space to Incubator 1.0 space with some support to Incubator 2.0 with a great deal of support including a fund. For that reason, it\u2019s important to develop a clear strategy for the type, style, clientele and support that will be built. This book provides guidance in three main areas: 1) What are the different options for incubators, accelerators and science parks, 2) How to assist the start-up founders (residents) and 3) How to manage the space.",
